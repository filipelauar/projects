# GAN applications

In this folder you will find 2 notebooks regarding the applications of GANs. One notebook was writen in portuguese and coded using pytorch to generate images of the MNIST. The other was writen in english and coded using tensorflow and keras to generate images of the MNIST and the CIFAR. I will keep including notebooks in this folder continuously. You should run these notebooks in google colab.

For more Deep Learning notebooks of CNN/GAN applications and much more in Portuguese I recommend [this repository](https://github.com/filipelauar/praticas) from UFMG professors.

Examples of many many applications in the real world using GANs can be founded in the following episodes of my podcast:
