# Manipulating images with StyleGAN

This project was done by (all contributed the same): Brayam Castillo, Filipe Lauar, Gabriel Baker and Vinícius Imaizumi

Project to use [StyleGAN](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan), [InterfaceGAN](https://github.com/genforce/interfacegan), [IDInvert](https://github.com/genforce/idinvert_pytorch) and [FaceAttributeFAN](https://github.com/TencentYoutuResearch/FaceAttribute-FAN) to manipulate images in StyleGAN's latent space.

You should run the [code on google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qVoqCA2i62PdcO2Pdfiv944mxHVN8zxt).

More details in the file GAN_report.pdf and you will find the explanation of the network achitecture and much more are in my podcast:

# Transforming images into paintings with CycleGAN

You should run this [code on google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XkWb_Qq0r1WYo9w7Qwo8ebjAHuZ09aTa#scrollTo=r_42Ar8j568A). You will just need to choose the files you want to upload and the results will be downloaded to your computer in a zip file.

The explanation of the network achitecture and other applications are in my podcast:

# Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering

In [this folder](https://github.com/filipelauar/projects/tree/main/dimensionality%20reduction%20and%20clustering) you will find 4 notebooks regarding the implementation and application of some dimensionality redcution and clustering methods.

You can run them on google colab following these link:

- [Implementation of PCA, KPCA and ICA.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1y6dBf9sK8S4mKVSXczqNYJXB89Qqc5XN#scrollTo=PWDH-owrOZMR)
- [Application of PCA, KPCA and ICA.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/150GaD4I611KlwSjTrlQe0Tnn8Bj1R4u5#scrollTo=1lu6Yp87h2rU)
- [Application of Kmeans.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DfSX8oqgB5eoO7fTyj1s72403HTqVGpM#scrollTo=MTt9L9DMgBtL)
- [Implementation and application of forward selection.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eq6q6a1FnmtUjgWc8sEu4AKJF-fOgFsq#scrollTo=eaH9Erj_6aee)


The explanation of the problemns, the methods and some applications are in my podcast:
