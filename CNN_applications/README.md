# CNN Applications

In this folder you will find 10 (4 in portuguese and 6 in english) notebooks regarding the applications of CNNs in classification, detection and segmentation. In these notebooks you will find examples of implementations from scratch, model declaration and fine tuning in pytorch, tensorflow/keras and mxnet. I will keep including notebooks in this folder continuously. You should run these notebooks in google colab.

For more Deep Learning notebooks of CNN applications and much more in Portuguese I recommend [this repository](https://github.com/filipelauar/praticas) from UFMG professors.

The explanation of the classification, detection and segmentation problemns, their applications in the real world and the state of the art for each method are in the following episodes of my podcast:
