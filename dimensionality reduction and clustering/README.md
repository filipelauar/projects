# Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering

In this folder you will find 4 notebooks regarding the implementation and application of some dimensionality redcution and clustering methods.

You can run them on google colab following these link:

- [Implementation of PCA, KPCA and ICA.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1y6dBf9sK8S4mKVSXczqNYJXB89Qqc5XN#scrollTo=PWDH-owrOZMR)
- [Application of PCA, KPCA and ICA.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/150GaD4I611KlwSjTrlQe0Tnn8Bj1R4u5#scrollTo=1lu6Yp87h2rU)
- [Application of Kmeans.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DfSX8oqgB5eoO7fTyj1s72403HTqVGpM#scrollTo=MTt9L9DMgBtL)
- [Implementation and application of forward selection.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eq6q6a1FnmtUjgWc8sEu4AKJF-fOgFsq#scrollTo=eaH9Erj_6aee)


The explanation of the problemns, the methods and some applications are in my podcast:
