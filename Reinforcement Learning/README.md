# Reiforcement Learning

In this folder you will find the implementation of many algorithms for Reinforcement Learning. These implementations were part of the RLD course in Sorbonne University. I would like to thank [Luc](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/luc-sterkers-0b2709210) and [Dao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dao-thauvin-908010208/) that implemented most of these algorithms (the RLD monsters). As it was all implemented in the course, in each folder I puted the project text so you guys can reproduce the experiments that we did. There is in the end a report of everything that was done but it's in French (sorry).

To better understand the idea of Reinforcement Learning, these and other algorithms and some application, you should listen to this episode in my podcast:
